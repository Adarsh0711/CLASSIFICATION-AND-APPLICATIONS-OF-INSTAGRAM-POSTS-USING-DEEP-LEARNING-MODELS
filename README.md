# CLASSIFICATION-AND-APPLICATIONS-OF-INSTAGRAM-POSTS-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-MODELS

We are using various CNN architectures on the “Instagram page Screen Shots
in 5 Category” Dataset where the dataset is categorized into: Beauty, Family, Fitness, Fashion
and Food with 27000 screenshots and 3,770 images explicitly labelled. Our main goal is to
focus on different deep learning models, do the classification process, enhancing the accuracy
and based on this we will curate content and recommendations for users based on similarity aspects using Siamese Network.
