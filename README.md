Classification-and-Application-of-Instagram-Content-Using-Deep-Learning-Models

###About
In this project I used various CNN architectures on the “Instagram page Screen Shots in 5 Category” Dataset where the dataset is categorized into: Beauty, Family, Fitness, Fashion and Food with 27000 screenshots and 3,770 images explicitly labelled. Our main goal is to focus on different deep learning models, do the classification process, enhancing the accuracy and based on this we will curate content and recommendations for users based on similarity aspects using Siamese Network.

###Model and Performance
